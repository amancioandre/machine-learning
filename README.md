# Machine Learning Study

This is the very start of my Data Science and Machine Learning road. But you can benefit from it as well: I will update the contents here regularly, books, YouTube channels, courses, webnars and repositories that I may encounter during this learning process.

## Goals

- [ ] Understand principles of Machine Learning
- [ ] Create and deploy my first Machine Learning Project
- [ ] Contribute with one organization
- [ ] Get a job focused on ML
- [ ] Get a PhD abroad
- [ ] Keep Learning

## Tools

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Giving Back

I will try, along the way, to write as much as I can about learning Machine Learning, the caveats I find along the way, my observations.
